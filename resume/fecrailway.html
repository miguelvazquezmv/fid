<p>FEC Train 105, a southbound weekday intermodal train, highballs the Eyster Blvd crossing in Rockledge, located in a few miles south of Cocoa Beach, on its southward journey towards Miami's Hialeah Yard. The leading locomotive behind this train was a GE ES44C4 engine No. 815
in a blue, cyan, and grey livery known as "Ferromex Blue". This was likely the fact that the parent company behind the FECR was owned by Grupo Mexico Transportes, the same parent company behind Ferromex in Mexico.</p>
